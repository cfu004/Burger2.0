# Burger 2

Replacing Sequelize with old fashioned ORM.
Simple burger game utilizing MySQL, Node, Express, handlebars, and Sequelize. 

Three different burgers in this app; each time a burger is consumed, corresponding column in MySQL would be changed through ORM.
The app uses Node and MySQL to query and route data, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.
